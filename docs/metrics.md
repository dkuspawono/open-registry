Metrics are collected in 15 second intervals from all services running in
connection with Open-Registry.

The point of these metrics is to be able to see the growth of the registry, any
pain points in the infrastructure and inspect any failures.

The metrics include everything from events happening in running applications,
commits landing in master, votes, finance and so on.

Each collected metric should have a purpose to be collected, that will benefit
the user. If we can skip the metric without loosing the ability to build something
great for our users, then we should skip it.
