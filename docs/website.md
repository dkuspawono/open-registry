### What is Open-Registry?

Open-Registry is a community-effort of regaining control of one of
the most important part of the JavaScript ecosystem, the module
registry.

It's purpose is to allow people to control the development, funding
and support of the registry itself, by making it fully open-source
and transparent for it's user and the public.

It's funded, developed and maintained fully by it's own users.

### Who is Open-Registry for?

Open-Registry is for JavaScript developers who want to make sure
all the modules in a JavaScript registry survives the test of time
and who want the registry to make changes only because it's users
want so, not because a company needs to improve profits.

### What's the features of Open-Registry?

- Serves a full mirror of the npm registry
- Funded by the community (self-sustainable)
- Governed by the community
- Developed by the community
- Sole focus on being a registry of JavaScript modules for it's users
- Finance, infrastructure, development and discussions about Open-Registry is fully transparent to the public

#### Future Goals

- Cryptographically signed packages
- Decentralized hosting of modules where many registry operators can contribute to the overall performance and stability
- To be adopted by OpenJS Foundation (or similar)
