# What is Open-Registry?

Open-Registry is a community-effort of regaining control of one of
the most important part of the JavaScript ecosystem, the module
registry.

It's purpose is to allow people to control the development, funding
and support of the registry itself, by making it fully open-source
and transparent for it's user and the public.

It's funded, developed and maintained fully by it's own users.

# Who is Open-Registry for?

Open-Registry is for JavaScript developers who want to make sure
all the modules in a JavaScript registry survives the test of time
and who want the registry to make changes only because it's users
want so, not because a company needs to improve profits.
