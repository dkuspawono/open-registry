## Governance of Open Registry

NOTICE: This is about to be setup and not complete. Help us finish it by giving
feedback!

### 1. Name & Purpose

The official name of the project and organization is "Open Registry".

The purpose of the organization is to facilitate development and sustainability
of the "Open Registry" project in public interest.

This means all members of the organization should consider users of the service
and code as the sole benefiters of the project, and all changes should be for
the users best. No more and no less.

## 2. Contributors

Contributors are individuals who are contributed once or more to the organization
or it's projects. These contributions include:

- Bug fixes
- Feature additions
- Bug triaging
- Funding
- Documentation changes
- Talks & Presentations in a venue with other people + public recording

## 3. Members

Members are Contributors who have contributed enough to merit participating
in organization votes. Members have the following responsibilities:

- All the responsibilities from being a Contributor
- Read, understand and clarify proposed RFCs
- Participate in Votes, while fully understanding the reasoning behind the Vote
- Voting for any changes in Leadership

## 4. Leadership

Leadership has the final say on the direction of the project. If no consensus
among Leadership can be found for a specific issue, a binding vote with
reasonable options should be presented to all Members.

These are the bylaws that the Open Registry acts by. Any changes to these bylaws
needs to be voted by the Contributing Group and to pass, needs to have a at
least 55% for it, with a 50% turnout.

Leadership has the following responsibilities:

- All the responsibilities from Members
- Evaluate carefully any proposed additions/removals from the Leadership
- Provide a Veto vote if a vote doesn't include all realistic options or biased question

### 4.1 How to become a part of Leadership

If a person would like to join Leadership, they need to:

- Represent themselves as an individual
- Start a Leadership Vote with existing Leadership and Members, arguing for
  their inclusion in the Leadership group
  - The vote should be open for at least two weeks
  - The vote needs to end up with a majority "yes" for the candidate, otherwise it's
    result is "no".

## 5. Discussions about Open Registry

No conversations or discussions about Open Registry between it's Members or Leadership
should be kept in private, and need to be accessible to at least Contributors
but preferably by the public. Private conversations are allowed between a limited
number of participators, as long as the full minute notes from the conversation
are published publicly.

## 6. Votes

Binding votes should be presented from the Leadership every time there is a 
issue or change proposed that cannot find a solution with majority consensus.

The binding vote should be open to Leadership, Members and Contributors, with
everyone being allowed one vote and everyones vote being considered equal.

The option with the most votes, wins.

The vote needs to be open at least two weeks to be considered valid.

If a realistic option is missing from the vote, or the initial question is biased
(or otherwise faulty), Leadership has the responsibility of vetoing the vote,
which lets the vote run fully but not consider the results.

After a veto, Leadership needs to prevent another veto for the next time by
adjusting the vote options or question.

## 7. RFCs

Before making bigger changes, the change should be presented as a RFC and
only move forward if consensus can be found among the Leadership on the proposed
change. This includes changes to these bylaws that control the governance of
the project.

## 8. Company-Representation

You're not allowed to be part of either Contributors, Members or Leadership
representing a company. You have to represent yourself as an individual and
make all decisions considering the best for the users of the service.

This is part of the Contributing pipeline, where to have your change request
accepted, you'll need to sign a Contributor License.

## Governance Inspiration

The governance setup currently has mostly be inspired by Homebrew, Rust,
and the Apache Foundation. Thanks to everyone who spent a lot of time setting
up a good precedent for how to govern a open source project.
