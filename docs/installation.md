## 10 second QuickStart

Getting started with Open-Registry could not be easier.

Simply run the following code snippet in your terminal and you're all set to go!

```bash
npm config set registry https://npm.open-registry.dev
```

If you use `yarn` instead of `npm` (or some other client), simply replace `npm`
above with `yarn` to use Open-Registry with `yarn`

```bash
yarn config set registry https://npm.open-registry.dev
```

### Stop using Open-Registry

It's not only simple to start using Open-Registry, it's easy to leave to. If
you at any point want to go back to not using Open-Registry, simply run the
following command in your terminal: (again, replacing `npm` with for example
`yarn`, if that's your client of choice)

```bash
npm config remove registry
```

## Start your own registry
> Notice: this section is only for users who have lots of space to run their
own registry, and can also maintain it. If you just want to use Open-Registry
without any complications, try the steps in the top of this document first.
