We are weighing the pros and cons and will update our roadmap accordingly. Meanwhile a workaround can be achieved by using npmrc to configure multiple profiles, with one profile pointing back to NPMs registry for audit purposes. The NPM docs detail this process with respect to configuration as an Enterprise user . Or you can simply follow our instructions here. 1 - Install npmrc if it's not already available npm i npmrc -g 2 - Create a profile for the public NPM registry npmrc -c npm npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.com/ 3 - Create a second profile for the Open Registry npmrc -c open npm config set registry https://npm.open-registry.dev 4 - Switch registries using the npmrc profile-name syntax.
