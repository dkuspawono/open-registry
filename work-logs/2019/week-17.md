# Work Log Week 17
> History of work done between 22th and 28th of April

### @victorb - Victor Bjekholm

- First obvious point is that Open-Registry had it's public launch, we're now up and running, hurrah!
- Spent some time creating a nicer development environment, adding more docs about it
- Deploying both the landing page and docs page (both via GitHub pages as CloudFlares dnslink hosting have issues with delayed updates)
- Started writing property tests for the MFS API for clj-ipfs-api (as we use MFS for caching)
- Wrote down quick thoughts on signed packages, reproducible builds, build-server, federation, financing and more
- Tried to find best way to setup financing, seems Open Collective Europe ASBL is the best we can find right now
- Wrote bunch of replies to people on GitHub, Reddit, Twitter and email
- Opened up communication channels with people from FreaJS about collaborative effort on federation
- Applied for doing talks about Open-Registry at BarcelonaJS + Opo.js (Porto, Portugal)
- Thought a lot more about federation and in the process of writing a proposal
